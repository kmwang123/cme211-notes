    "Fortunately, in our neighborhoods, we know in advance exactly how many pieces of candy each home hands out to the children. A child has to take all the candy given by the home so they don't seem rude, and they can't throw away or eat any candy on the way. Children also have to stop at every home in the sequence of homes.\n",
